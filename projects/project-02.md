# Zero Trust Network Traffic Analysis

## Overview

This project is a real-time network traffic monitoring and alerting system built using JavaFX. It focuses on Zero Trust principles by allowing users to define custom rules to block or flag suspicious traffic. The application integrates with Snort for intrusion detection and prevention but also provides a demo mode for presentations and testing when Snort is unavailable.

## Key Features

- **Custom Rule Monitoring:**
  - Define blacklists, whitelists, port monitoring, protocol anomalies, and time-based access in `manual_rules.json`.
  - Dynamically apply rules to live or demo alerts.

- **Snort Integration:**
  - Monitor Snort's alert logs in real-time.
  - Operate in IDS (detection) or IPS (prevention) mode.

- **User-Friendly JavaFX GUI:**
  - View and manage alerts in a table format.
  - Buttons for clearing alerts, generating reports, and sending email summaries.

- **Demo Mode:**
  - Automatically activates when Snort is not running.
  - Displays sample alerts for testing and showcasing functionality.

- **Batch Scripts for Snort Modes:**
  - `start_snort_ids.bat`: Starts Snort in intrusion detection mode.
  - `start_snort_ips.bat`: Starts Snort in intrusion prevention mode.

- **Email Notifications & Reports:**
  - Send alert summaries via email using customizable SMTP configurations.
  - Generate timestamped text-based reports in the `reports/` directory.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming:** Java, JavaFX
- **Build Tool:** Gradle
- **IDS/IPS Integration:** Snort
- **File Configuration:** JSON (for rules)
